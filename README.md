# Rchoice #

Rchoice  is a package in R for estimating Ordered, Binary and Poisson models with random parameters for cross-sectional and panel data.

### What kind of models can be estimated? ###

* Binary (Logit/Probit), Ordered (Logit/Probit) and Poisson Models with fixed (non-stochastic) parameters.
* Binary (Logit/Probit), Ordered (Logit/Probit) and Poisson models with random coefficients. The distribution of the coefficients can be normal, log-normal, truncated normal, triangular, uniform and Johnson Sb.
* Random Effects model for Panel or longitudinal data.
* Estimate the conditional individual-specific coefficient.
* Binary models with (Logit/Probit) with heteroskedasticity using MLE and compute the marginal effects. 
* Probit model with endogenous continuous covariate using MLE and compute marginal effects.
